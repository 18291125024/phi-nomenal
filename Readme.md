![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/Charterhouse/TruffleDevEnv.svg?branch=master)

This is a template project to quickly get started with development of
Ethereum smart contracts and the web interface to them. It provides a
setup based on [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com) for the smart
contracts, and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for client-side
JavaScript. It also provides a setup for unit testing both the smart
contracts and the client-side code.

### Usage

1. Fork this repository; forking it will allow you to easily take in
   updates later on.
2. Modify the `package.json` files (in the root and in the projects
   inside `local_modules`) so that they contain the information about
   your project.
3. Run `yarn run devsetup` to have all Node dependencies installed.
