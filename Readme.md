# Introduction.

The creation of a platform which facilitates/enables the coming together of buyers and sellers of goods and services. A place where a need/ request can be served in many different ways by many different parties. The Trade Hub.
Moving goods effortlessly through the supply chain with multiple partners driven by geographical customer demand. Traditional logistic partners will remain, however through flash companies, create access for smaller parties to participate. Quick registration of a peer node in the blockchain as a trading partner makes this possible.
Full inventory tracking- detailing attributes of value (such as carbon emissions, origin etc) available and transparent. Real-time inventory tracking showing inventory balances per location and in transit, coupled with customer demand- creates the opportunity for peer logistic providers to indicate an interest to transact/ move goods around.
This trading hub is safe and reliable as partner's capabilities are verified through validation of their existence and prior transactions. No further checks needed.
Geographical customer demand
The customer has the choice of purchasing items based on attributes which matter to him or her. This will drive the demand. Through leveraging information available in the blockchain- smart logistic decisions are possible- through efficient, timely and carbon-neutral options available by suppliers in the trade hub. Moving stock from one point to another, and collaboratively between retailers.
2. The principle
The current supply chain is a sequence of processes and transaction which limits end-to-end transparency on transactions as well as inventories. This is a result of different parties in the supply have no prime interest to share this information as well as the result of a lack of "public" infrastructure to allow this sharing. Now when companies do share accross the supply chain, this is done through connecting with / interfacing between companies' ERP systems (or other).

This is where blockchain
